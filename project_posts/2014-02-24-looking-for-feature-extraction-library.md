## How to easily detect faces and facial features

Computer vision, face detection and feature extraction have been around for quite a while. The best known, freely available, library is [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). As impressive as it is, it is a c++ based library that need quite a bit of tweeking and compilation, and makes it hard to use widely, specifically online.
Looking up openCV js ports yielded so far the following:

1. [node-opencv](https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv)
2. [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) - this is obviously not a JS library but python is suitable for early stage quick prototyping and implementation.
