## Finding the right tool

Last time I spoke about finding the right lightweight, easy to use, feautre extraction library. I mentioned SimpleCV and node-opencv.

Trying both, including installation and configuration was a story in itself. It took a few hours and lots of stackoverflow posts and the result was not good enough. Went back to google, tweaked my search terms and voila! The perfect candidate was found. Clmtracker by **Audun Mathias Ã˜ygard** (thank you Audun!) seems like the right tool for the job. Dealing with image processing for quite a while, I found this library easy to download and install and it does a great job. Not only that it does a good feature extraction, it generates a set of 71 points(!) from a facial image: 


Such high level tracking with large number of points enables experimenting with the interpretation and transformation of the facial proportions to a naive home.

For the time being, I run the files locally and modify it so that HLB can start a study in the search for the right language and interpretation. Here is a simple example using Audun's own image:
