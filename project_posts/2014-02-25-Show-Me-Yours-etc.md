## Show me yours ... and I will show you mine
Whether we like it or not, we like to measure and compare. It is a sort of a "game" (instinct) we are involved in constantly. What's my influence rank compared to yours? How many re-tweets did I get? How many candy crush levels did I finish (and how much did you)?
It seems only obvious that once people will start producing their homefaces (and yes, we've got a long way to get there), they would like to compare, measure and well... play.
To enable this, we should look into enabling saving and sharing of their generated homes. This requires authentication, saving the data and enabling selective (or public) sharing of the results. This seems like a good time to start looking into google services and start picking the relevant ones.

Initial thoughts and issues:
- We should save (store) coordinates (vectors) data. This will reduce storage size, enable scaling, drawing, re-drawing, comparing, merging, mixing and overyaling.
- But what about the original image? If it is from an external URL, storing is still 'low cost'. What about users who chose to use their webcam to take their image?
