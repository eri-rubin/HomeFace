So, HLB and MS met for the first time to discuss the project. As Google's rep described it, it is not only about the technology and the implementation but also about the process and the unique gathering of a an artist and a coder. The dialog that's built and the journey for a common language.

For MS it is not the first time of stepping out of his domain and crossing over. MS was technology manager for 7 years at LIRT - Laboratory for Innovation in Rehabilitation Technology (University of Haifa). LIRT was originally started by Prof. Tamar Weiss, an occupational therapist (OT) and the first generation of researchers was composed of OTs. As the lab grew bigger, it brought in researchers from various fields including physiotherapy, psychology and brain research.

During his work with the lab, MS was responsible for understanding the research thesis, defining the technical needs, finding the relevant technology, implementing the solution and assisting in maintenance of the various systems. The work included a diverse set of technologies, among which:

- Virtual Reality
- Video Motion
- Head Tracking
- Game engines and game development
- Data analysis (mainly matlab)
- Large scale touch surfaces (Mitubishi's Diamond Touch)
- Head Mounted Displays (HMD)
- Wacom Tablets

(and many many others).

One term that rose during these productive and joyful years is "accessibility via affordability". Finding the affordable solution, one which can run on stock hardware and easily installed and integrated was a key guideline for the team. Using high end, proprietary systems (HW and SW) might yield eye catching and impressive results yet limit the work to the lab.

Another important take away for MS was learning to work with people from different disciplines. Being a techie for most of his adult life, the analytic, technical and solution oriented approach, became an obstacle. The "professional socialization" habits of hi-tech workers are different from those of OTs (or artists for this matter). This led to the understanding that insisting on practical, well defined, ideas might stop the creative process. This understanding enabled a great opening for a different kind of collaboration and listening. The first stage of defining a new project involved bringing up the problem (idea, inspiration), exploring various alternatives, trying to define the relevant dimensions and only then, slowly, crystallizing it into a well defined system/solution (or, in this case, art installation).

To set a common ground, we started by going through some existing code based art works. Among which are:
- [Ted's Quixotic](http://www.ted.com/talks/quixotic_fusion_dancing_with_light.html)
- Camille Utterback's [Text Rain](http://camilleutterback.com/projects/text-rain/)
- [Palindrom's](http://palindrome.de) work
- [messa di voce](http://www.tmema.org/messa/messa.html)
- [Context Free Art](http://www.contextfreeart.org/)
- [Build with Chrome](https://www.buildwithchrome.com)
- [Sound Sculpture](http://vimeo.com/38840688)

(and, again, many many others)

HLB brought up the fact that she is fascinated by facades of homes, the Golden Ratio, and the fact that there is a great resemblance between the naive home we draw as kids and the human face, mouth as the door, eyes as the windows and our face's contour as the walls and roof, and so our journey, our adventure, begins.

Following the meeting, it appears that:
1. We need to find a feature extraction library
2. We gravitate towards a light weight, easy to use technology and platforms
3. The work will probably consist of 2 parts, the online accessible part, which will implement the basic idea, and potentially accumulate data and experiences and the final, physical, installation which will create a space specific experience.
4. A face (proportions) to drawing language is needed, one that will be meaningfull, intuitive to grasp. This language should also create a noticeable differences between each person.

MS's initial direction is to look for a JS based face detection and feature extraction library which is easy to integrate and operate. Also, an easy to use, canvas based library is required. [Processing](http://processing.org/) has been recently [ported to JS](http://processingjs.org/) and seems like a very interesting candidate.

Stay tuned, this is going to get interesting.
