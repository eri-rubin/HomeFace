## Description
**HomeFace** is an interactive system that does feature extraction from the human face and draws a *naive* home based on the previously extracted positions.
The [_Golden Ratio_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio "See definition on wikipedia") is known for being aesthetically pleasing and now wonder the human face proportions and distances hold this ratio. As an artist who has an ongoing interest in [_the facades of homes_](http://www.hila-laiser-beja.com/#!photographs "HBJ's home art"), HBJ believes the way we draw the naive home and our relationship to it is not incidental, further more, HBJ believes that home sketches generated from our "sampled" face proportions will reflect and symbolize our own unique identity.
